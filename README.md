# abstractdrawmachine
Here are my drawing machines examples from 3.0 - 3.3.
<br>
My final drawing machine is based on my wish to be able to create cool and abstract art,  since my paint skills aren't the greatest, blindly creating lines and curves seemed alot more apealling since it created hypnotic artwork for my own eyes. So have some fun and play with my machine, I'd love to hear the commentary and other colors I should add than just violet, green, yellow+pink, and white+black!!
<br>
Here are a few of the pieces and examples!
